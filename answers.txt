1. How to modify the code to support different file versions?
As i have a Parser i will create a wrapper function for the first call in this case. 
This function will operate a version of file by 1st line and call the exact methods for this version.
I mean that we need to split logic for every version in another function because it's not proper to do everything in one.
2. How would the import system change if exchange rate data is removed from the file, and it needs to be obtained asynchronously (via API)?
We can request it from server where this information can be saved before.
3. In the future, if the client wants to import files via a web interface, how would the system need to be changed?
I design API in ay it can easily connect to Front-end side and it provide a meaningful response already.
4. How would the queries change if imported data could be considered only for the previous month/year?
Some of methods already includes a support for providing a specific constrains. It can be done throw adding a parameters to our endpoints.
Then we can refactor our SQL-requests based on it.
